# AI-Arena

This fighting game confronts two fighters with each playing either as a human player, a classic AI design or a Reinforcement Learning agent. As a player you can choose an agent you would like to fight or you can simply watch those agents fight against each other as a spectator.

By pressing the Play button the starting screen will automatically be loaded. To disable that feature, go to File/Scene Autoload and choose "Don't Load Master On Play".
